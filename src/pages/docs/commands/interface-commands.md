## What are interface commands?

The interface commands allow you to use the same tools as the [interface channel feature](/docs/features/voice-channel-generators#what-is-an-interface-channel) except without the need for a special channel.

{% callout title="Owner" %}
For all these commands (except claim) you need to be the owner of the voice channel.
{% /callout %}
