## Features

VC Roles is a bot that will make your server and its voice channels much more interactive, enabling features such as: giving members roles when they join a voice channel, removing it on leave or the reverse of that, reading TTS messages in voice channels, for those without a mic, creating and managing voice channels, and much more!

This is the bot you need to make your server more interactive, and bring your community together!

-   [Channel - Role linking](/docs/features/linking)
    -   Normal linking - A role(s) can be given to a member when they join a channel, and removed when they leave
    -   Reverse Linking - A role(s) can be removed from a member when they join a channel, and added when they leave
    -   Great for hiding voice reply channels, or music bot command channels when they aren't needed
-   [All channel - Role linking](/docs/features/all-linking)
    -   A role(s) will be given to a member when they join any voice channel, and removed when they leave
    -   Option to add exception channels (members aren't given the 'all' role(s) when they join/leave)
    -   Normal & Reverse Linking supported
-   [Permanent Role Links](/docs/features/permanent-links)
    -   A role(s) will be given to a member when they join the voice channel, and will remain after they leave.
    -   Normal & Reverse Linking supported
    -   Great for easy user verification
-   [Voice Channel Generators](/docs/features/voice-channel-generators)
    -   When a member joins the generator channel a new voice channel is made just for them, and is deleted when there are no more members in the channel.
    -   Generators also come with an interface channel, which contains additional configuration for users' private channels.
    -   This is highly configurable, dive in and see what you can make!
-   [Voice Channel TTS commands](/docs/features/tts)
    -   TTS commands are used to make the bot read a message in a voice channel
    -   Options for multiple languages.
    -   Great for users who have no mic and still want to be heard
-   [Voice Admin Commands](/docs/features/voice-admin)
    -   Used to mute, unmute, deafen and undeafen all members in a voice channel
-   [Audit logging (for voice channels)](/docs/features/audit-logs)
    -   See when members join, leave or change channels, and the roles that are given/removed by the bot.
